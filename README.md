# k5dru_setup

Personal setup scripts for Centos 7 / Fedora 22 type operating systems, created to be fast, simple, understandable, modifiable, flexible and repeatable. The goal is to automate, and thereby document, all setup functions from the base install to a functional desktop or application server.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Current professional systems admins should have a better way of doing this. You can use these scripts as examples, or as-is if they fit your use case, with absolutely no warranty or support expressed or implied.
